## Structure Tensor Analysis in R

This repository provides an implementation of Structure Tensor Analysis in R, a technique used for analyzing directional features in images and multidimensional datasets.

The structure tensor is widely used in image processing, computer vision, and medical imaging for extracting orientations, edge detection, and anisotropy measurements.

The aim of this repo is to demonstrate how R is becoming a powerhouse for scientific computing through the integration of Torch. Torch for R brings GPU-accelerated deep learning, powerful N-dimensional arrays, comprehensive mathematical functions, and an easy-to-use syntax into Râ€”capabilities that have traditionally been the domain of Python. We will demonstrate structure tensor analysis on a 3D fiber volume to reveal directional arrangements and orientation of these fibers such as below:
